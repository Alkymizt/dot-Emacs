Dr. Jordan B. Peterson (on claiming Belief in God: Commentary, YouTube)

On embitterment
Life is difficult, it is tainted by malevolence.  And it's cast in
tragedy and you need something to offset that because otherwise it
embitters you.  And if you are embittered then you become vengeful and
cruel, inevitably. Then you make everything that's made you worse,
worse in turn - and there is not bottom to that recursive cycle.

Excellent Point - Thinking and paying attention
From Religious mythology, there is a difference between thinking and
paying attention.  Of the two, paying attention is much more
important. It's not the same thing as thinking, when you are paying
attention you are looking for what you don't know.  You, in a sense,
detach yourself, and you watch, and you listen, and you see if things
are the way you think they are.  And you hope they are because life is
easier if things are the way you think they are.  But if you find out
that there not, and you're paying attention then you can weave, and you
can bob, and you can adapt, and you can learn.  And so you have to learn
to pay attention.

Path for life:
We are very imitative creatures. Our instinct for admiration, is the
instinct for imitation. And a deeply biological and metaphysically rooted
guidline to the proper path of life. The question is, is there a
proper path of life.  Well, there are certainly pathways that make
things worse.  That's something to know, you can avoid those.  And if
there are pathways that make things worse, there are also the opposite
pathways even thought those may not be so clear.

Who do you admire, well we can start by who don't you admire.  You
don't admire an adult who could yet won't take responsibility for
him/her-self.  But you don't admire somebody who won't take
responsibility for themselves.  In fact you have a sense of contempt
for that.  And if you happen to be that person, then you wake up in
the middle of the night and berate yourself with what little is left
of your conscience for failing to undertake your moral duty - your
intrinsic moral duty and you can't escape that. You can't escape the
bitter pangs of conscience, inevitably you do (feel them).  And the
reason you do is because you are doing things that are wrong.  And you
should stop and you know it, maybe you can't...

When you are in that place where you are acting in the proper manner
and you're facing things courageously, and you are speaking the truth
- you're imbued with a sense of fundamental meaning.  And that meaning
is the antedote to the catastrophy of life!

We're not nothing, us human beings.  They say that we are made in the
image of God, and it is hard to say what that means.  But, it means at
least in part to participate in the process of bringing the good into
being, and we can all do that and the opposite. If we accept our
responsibility to ourselves, and to other people, and to our
communities, and we lift that load up, then we live lives that are
meaningful. And that stops us from being corrupt, it provides us with
a medication against catastrophy. And it also practically improves the
world.

... There's a reason for hope.  And there's something to be said to
know you're the sort of creature that can look mortality, and
catastrophy, and malevolance straight in the eye, so to speak, and
nonetheless standup and do what's right.  And that all there is in
that is good!


Fredrick Nietzsche

Takes most writers a whole book to write what I can write in a
sentence. No they can't even manage it in a book. Beyond Good & Evil.

"Fiction lies to you in the most truthful possible manner."

Something valuable, given up, ensures future prosperity.
Something valuable, sacrificed, pleases the Lord.
