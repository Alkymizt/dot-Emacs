Resilience & Health

Definition:
A calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1
gram of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C (by 1 °C) at 1 atomosphere
pressure.



Carbohydrates ~ 4 kcal/g
Proteins ~ 4 kcal/g
Fats ~ 9 kcal/g

VO2 = amount of oxygen we consume per unit time
VCO2 = amount of carbon dioxide we produce per unit time
RQ = Ratio of VCO2 to VO2 (aka respitory quotient)
