Fill Weight Guidelines for Tubes.

For Larger Tubes:
Breathing room = Diameter + 1 cm from top of Tube
You want to make sure your max fill does not go above this line or is at least
1 cm below this line. This establishes feasability of the tube.

For Smaller Tubes: TBD

Example:
11936-C Hemp Foaming Face Wash

Claim: 150 ml
First Iteration Analysis:
1.021 * 150 = 153.15 (Claim 154 g)

Min Fill Weight: 156 g ==> y1 * 154 = 157 ==> y1 = 156/154 ==> y1 = 1.0129
Max Fill Weight: 160 g ==> y2 * 160 = 160 ==> y2 =  160/154 ==> 72 = 1.0389
This very tight fill leads to an extremely (not measurable within our capacity) 
SG range, if we are to have a volumetric fill and have a product that has a 
measurable/passable SG range simultaneously.

======
Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates:
  1. Is it true?
  2. Is it necessary?
  3. Is is kind?

If we are going to get married then the guiding fundamental principle has to be
truth and honesty.
