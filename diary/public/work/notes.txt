Need to establish a specific method to determine specific gravity for the Herban
Cowboy Shave Cream, current specification and measurements are not meeting
specification. Previous specifications were defined by Angel and there are many
unkown parameters as to how this range was specified. Product is a volumetric
fill, which is problematic in changing the SG specification range as this will
directly impact meeting volume fill claim.

Need to re-consider the pH specification, we should remove this specification
altogether since it is not logical to define a pH range on a product that does
not have the means to control pH and/or adjust it, we are at the sole discretion
of the raw materials that we receive, which more or less fall within the
specification of the COA that they are provided with.
