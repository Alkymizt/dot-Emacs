Direction from Irvaz:
When QC comes in with an issue with approval/specifications of products - they
need to have first talked with Chris, their manager, in regards to the issue
and whether it is indeed an issue that needs to be addressed to R&D. Currently,
they have been bringing all concerns to R&D, even though it is not in the scope
of a product correction.

Stability protocols
Need to get with Chris to establish SOPs for these and to train Julina and
establish these protocols in practice.

1 Preliminary (aka Accelerated)
2 Basic (organoleptic)
3 Extended (pH, weight, viscosity, etc)
4 OTC

KSCNJFC - BATCH19350-08 CANNUKA JELLY FACE CLEANSER

EXPERIMENTAL CORRECTION #1 (2019.12.19)
PROCEDURE: 
We used 50 lbs from the product currently in the tank, and upon removal we
observed that the product is indeed unstable and has begun the process to
seperate, i.e. oils are not being held within the gel structure. We heated the
product up to 40 - 45 °C, in K8 and began propeller mixing. We mixed the product
at this temperature for 30 minutes, and due to the impartation of friction the
final temperature of the product rose to 52 °C. We then applied cooling for the
last 10 minutes of mixing, however, the temperature remained at 52 °C. The 
result of this experiment seemed to indicate that mixing did allow the oils to
be re-incorporated back into the gel and we achieved a lighter look that is 
representative of the approved sample and what was made successfully in the
pilot.

EXPERIMENTAL CORRECTION #2
Plan - rework product still currently in tank (BATCH#), same procedure as
mentioned in EXP. 1, then we will perform an 80/20 mix of that batch with
the broken batch (BATCH#) with mixing.

EXPERIMENTAL CORRECTION #3
Plan is to create a base using Barsolve NS-100 D-Phase Emulsion technology,
what we used in YL Foot Scrub (PDR # 10410) and generate a stable base and
incorporate the broken batch in hopes of salvaging the material.

CBD Handling

As was communicated from Irvaz: Jeff, Chris and Kim had a meeting discussing the
handling of CBD and this was a responsibility that was to be handled by Chris as
he takes on the role of QC manager. Batch sheets are NOT to be changed in the
system, and how the modification of CBD concentrations per batch based on lot is
an issue to be discussed and handled within the QC department. There seems
to be some push back here and what was also mentioned was the concern of
tracking, however, this can be done on a per batch sheet basis. I was instructed
by Irvaz to NOT adjust a batch sheet, or change the formula in the system. Also,
the safe and storage of the CBD is now in the office of the lab, and it was
indicated that I was to be responsible for the CBD, both lab samples and
production, however this is NOT within the scope of my responsibilities and I
should NOT be held accountable for production's CBD safekeeping, again this is
something to be determined by Chris and the QC department. I will have to hold a
strict line here as I am currently getting push back, not in a direct manner, but
rather from a tertiary sense from production workers - seems misinformation is
being communicated from the QC department as this has not been discussed at all
from the R&D department.

Quality and Production issues of existing products.

In my observation, there is already way too much handling of quality production
issues that the lab is being held responsible for dealing with and it is strongly
interfering with our main objective which is to provide quality samples in a
timely manner to prospective, new, and existing clients. I understand that the
lab is responsible for overseeing scale up and pilot batches, which is what we
are currently doing, however, QC department is being direlect in its duties to
handle issues of products that have long been out of this scope - this was being
handled.

Scale-Up & QC functions:

Scale-Up is currently consumed with the following tasks:

  1. Color Standard Solutions: This is a function of ensuring quality - QC
  2. Citric Acid Standards: This is a function of ensuring quality - QC
  3. Any existing product Standard: A function of ensuring quality - QC
  4. New product specification Standard setting: Scale-up
  5. Pilot batch specification Standard setting: Scale-up
  6. Troubleshooting off-specs of existing products: a function of ensuring
     quality - QC, i.e. BAREMINERALS QUICK CHANGE BRUSH CLEANER (KWBEQCBC)
     this is a recurring issue that should be handled by QC, they have the batch
     record of previous changes.
  7. Troubleshooting off-specs of recent products: QC & R&D, R&D will aid in
     developing a solution, however, QC should record and log solution and then
     handle the situation in the future.  If problem continues to exist, then QC
     shall bring batch record of 3 or more occurences of this issue (an average
     requires at least 3 occrences) and then R&D/Scale-up shall adjust the batch
     sheet accordingly.

all calibio batches:

This is for QC, this needs to be transmitted before the batch is being made. This
will be to ensure that the batch sheet was updated from previous batches.

Check for previous work orders for any updates or changes.

And make a sign off for a QC Technitian and date before the batch can be made.

Sucragel - If heated for too long it will loose it H2O and eventually not be able
to form a stable gel, the oils will begin to seperate out.  This is most likely
due to the imbalance of H20 required for the sucragel to form a gel.  To fix,
once can take a sample of the seperated batch and add aliquotes of H2O until the
gel is stabilized.

Sucragel technology is based off of D Phase Emulsification, see URL:

Need to establish a specific method to determine specific gravity for the Herban
Cowboy Shave Cream, current specification and measurements are not meeting
specification. Previous specifications were defined by Angel and there are many
unkown parameters as to how this range was specified. Product is a volumetric
fill, which is problematic in changing the SG specification range as this will
directly impact meeting volume fill claim.

KWBEQCBC BAREMINERALS QUICK CHANGE BRUSH CLEANER

Need to re-consider the pH specification, we should remove this specification
altogether since it is not logical to define a pH range on a product that does
not have the means to control pH and/or adjust it, we are at the sole discretion
of the raw materials that we receive, which more or less fall within the
specification of the COA that they are provided with.

The current reason why we cannot simply change the specifications for pH, is
because Janet, says they have been the same for over a "decade" and she doesn't
want to change them for that reason.  However, I believe that we need to revisit
all of our legacy products and do a re-evaluation of the specifications to ensure
that they meet our updated and improved SOPs and equipement, ultimately
ensuring that our customer receive the best products possible.  If anything, with
an improved specification set our clients will be receiving overall better
products in my estimation.

Production Fill Weight Documentation Change

Scenario:
=========
Line Manager may ask to change fill weight range:

Descripion:
===========
Never change range to expand lower end of fill range, product must
meet claim weight.  This require evaluation to expand upper end of fill weight
specification. However, if they are having difficulty filling minimum requirement
of the fill weight specification, then the fill weight range needs to be
re-evaluated, upper end of Specific Gravity needs to be carefully considered in
this re-evaluation (esp. when dealing with a volumetric fill) as this will effect
the ability to meet fill weight claims for volumetric fills.

SOP (heresay):
==============
Provided the fill weight form, Lab Manager (supposedly, not sure if this should
be a function of the Lab Manager position), a new expanded range may be provided
signed and dated, which will then be given to Account Manager.  The Account
Manager of the said product should be notified before the range is adjusted.  The
required fill weight documentation, attached to the Project in Formulator must
then be updated accordingly to reflect any changes.

# Production Scheduling Meetings

Purpose of these meetings for R&D Lab Manager is to provide formulation
information not immediately known to scheduler/Production Manager/Compounding
Manager on needed equipment - essentially to double check that batches are
scheduled in proper compounding equipment, i.e. kettles/tanks with adequate
mixing equipment, also need to be privy on effervescent equipment as well.
Possibly set up time to meet with KJ and/or someone who can brush me up on this
information, go over and review problematic formulations for production etc.
