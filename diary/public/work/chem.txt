Hexaglyn PR-15 [mfgr/suplr: Barnet]

INCI:  Polyglyceryl-6 Polyricinoleate

Solubility:  Oil Dispersible

Use Level:  0.10-4.00%

Description:
Hexaglyn PR-15 is a natural water-in-oil emulsifier and dispersing agent. It is a
must-have for any pigmented formulations as it was tested to have superior
dispersing properties. It is also recommended as an emulsion stabilizer for
water-in-oil emulsions.

Architecture/Technology:
Hexaglyn PR-15 is a highly purified polyglyceryl fatty acid ester synthesized
with hexaglycerin and polymers of ricinoleic acid.  It is an ethoxylate-free
surfactant derived from a vegetable source.  Hexaglyn PR-15 is a nonionic
surfactant containing many non-reactive hydroxyl groups, therefore, it has a high
affinity for inorganic pigments.  In addition, because of its unique purification
process, Hexaglyn PR-15 has excellent oxidation and electrolyte stability and
imparts no color in formulations.

Function:  Emulsifier/Dispersant

Background:  Ricinoleic Acid, an unsaturated Omega-9 fatty acid and an a hydroxy
acid.  A main component derived from Castor seed Oil (Ricinus communis L.,
Euphorbiaceae).  About 90% of the fatty acid content in castor oil is the
triglyceride formed from ricinoleic acid.
